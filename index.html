        <u>Experimental VHF Magnetic Loop Antenna for 2 Metre Amateur Band</u></font><br>

        Introduction</u>:<br>
        <img border="0" src="mag_loop_principle.jpg" align="right" width="220" height="220">
        The described antenna was constructed and
        tested in order to learn something about the physical principles by
        which electric power may be coupled to &quot;free space&quot;.&nbsp;
        There is nothing new about Magnetic Loop Antennas in general.&nbsp;
        Short wave versions are sometimes used by radio amateurs who,
        typically, would locate them inside the roof.&nbsp; This might happen in
        a situation where a conventional external antenna would breach local
        regulations.&nbsp; The unusual aspect about the antenna here described
        is that it is very compact and designed to function at 144.30 MHz in the
        2 metre amateur band.&nbsp; At this frequency a Magnetic Loop Antenna is
        quite unique.&nbsp; An amateur radio licence would be required before
        making transmissions.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">The antenna is constructed from standard
        copper water pipe and plumbing fixtures available from most
        hardware&nbsp; stores.&nbsp; It functions on the principle of the
        magnetic loop which is, essentially, a series-tuned resonant circuit in
        which the inductor is a single-turn loop.&nbsp; A high voltage is
        developed across the capacitive gap, hence a voltage standing wave is
        developed around the periphery of the loop.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">The efficiency of the antenna depends
        upon the generation of high current and voltage.&nbsp; Hence the Q will
        be high and the bandwidth correspondingly narrow (typically 200
        MHz).&nbsp; The resonant frequency is designed to be 144.30 which is the
        amateur s.s.b. calling frequency.&nbsp; To make the Q high the losses
        must be kept very low, and for this reason the antenna is constructed
        from copper water pipe of 22 mm diameter.&nbsp; Sturdy construction is
        also necessary to provide the necessary mechanical stability.&nbsp; The
        antenna is constructed to the minimum size possible.&nbsp; It is
        believed that the size could not be any greater because the capacitance
        necessary for resonance would become impracticably small.&nbsp;
        Therefore the constructor is recommended to keep closely to the
        dimensions shown below and to construct the antenna as accurately as
        possible.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4"><u><br>
      General remarks</u>:<u><br>
      </u>It may be necessary to develop a little skill in plumbing.&nbsp;
      Soldering is best performed with a butane blowtorch.&nbsp; Apply flux
      beforehand.&nbsp; Be careful not to overheat the joints or the solder will
      drain out.&nbsp; Soldering may best be performed with the joint
      vertical.&nbsp; While heating watch the underside of the joint for the
      first appearance of liquid solder and remove the heat when this is seen.&nbsp;
      Joints already soldered may be wrapped in a wet rag to reduce the chance of
      accidentally de-soldering them while soldering an adjacent joint.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><u><br>

      (1)&nbsp; Cut the pipes to the specified lengths and clean the surfaces with steel wool.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">(2)&nbsp; Drill holes in the tee for the feeder grommet,
      and for the screw which will secure the solder tag for connecting the coaxial cable braid.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">(3)&nbsp; Assemble the antenna using the elbows and the tee, but on the
      capacitive gap side of the square substitute a 102 mm long pipe <b>in place of</b> the
      capacitive gap components.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">(4)&nbsp; Solder the joints, <b>but do not</b> solder those holding the substitute pipe.</font>

      components in their final location.&nbsp; Do not solder the 22-to-15 mm
      dia. reducer at this time.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">(6)&nbsp; In order to make final adjustments to the
      resonant frequency, a very small self-tapping screw must be screwed into
      the 22 mm straight coupler, close to the end.&nbsp; The screw should
      protrude about halfway across the airgap to the 22-to-15 mm dia.

      file off the point.</font>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">(7)&nbsp; The antenna is supported by a 15 mm dia.
      vertical pipe which is soldered to another 22-to-15 mm dia. reducer which
      is joined to the tee at right-angles to the the plane of the loop.&nbsp;
      This vertical pipe may be attached to a magnetic mount (for example) using
      a suitable plumbing fixture with the antenna at about one quarter-wave
      above the magnetic mount.&nbsp; Originally it was found that the vertical
      supporting pipe was slightly &quot;hot&quot; to r.f.&nbsp; Therefore a
      short plastic tube was used to insulate the antenna from the vertical pipe
      (although this is not essential).&nbsp; The plastic tube was a 22 mm dia.

    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">(8)&nbsp; The coaxial cable is coupled to the antenna by
      an inductive loop of about 40 mm diameter.&nbsp; Use 16 gauge copper wire
      soldered to the same tag to which the coaxial cable braid is connected.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><u><br>
      Adjustment</u>:<br>
      Initially it is convenient to adjust the resonant frequency while
      receiving a weak signal close to 144.30 MHz.&nbsp; The 22-to-15 mm dia.
      reducer should be positioned to optimise the received signal
      strength.&nbsp; If the received signal cannot be tuned in this way, then
      some change to the dimensions of the loop would be necessary.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">The final tuning adjustment must be made while
      transmitting.&nbsp; Connect a VSWR meter between the transmitter and
      antenna.&nbsp; Be very careful, because r.f. output transistors can easily
      by destroyed by operating a transmitter into a gross mismatch.&nbsp;
      Therefore use a little power as possible when making the tuning
      adjustment.&nbsp; One way to generate low power (in single sideband. mode)
      is to whistle very softly into the microphone.&nbsp; The sensitivity
      control of the VSWR meter should be turned-up high.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">With the VSWR meter indicating reflected power the
      impedance match is is optimised by positioning the 22-to-15 mm dia.
      reducer.&nbsp; Finally secure the reducer to the elbow by soldering.&nbsp;
      Do this very gently and without further moving it.&nbsp; (This may be
      difficult because flux cannot be applied for this operation, so make sure
      that the inner and outer surfaces are cleaned beforehand with steel wool).</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">The closeness of the the antenna to its correct resonant
      frequency may be tested by moving a finger near to the capacitive gap,
      whereupon the VSWR meter should indicate a change in the reflected
      power.&nbsp; If necessary, adjust the resonant frequency with the
      self-tapping screw already inserted in the 22 mm straight coupler.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">Another means of tuning the antenna if close to the
      correct frequency is to distort the structure very slightly, hence either
      increasing or reducing the capacitive gap.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><br>
      <u>Performance</u>:<img border="0" src="VHF_loop4.jpg" align="right" width="510" height="321"><br>
      The performance of the antenna may best be assessed in comparison with a
      half-wave dipole.&nbsp; Although objective tests have yet to be performed,
      initial experience suggests that the magnetic loop antenna performs at
      least as well as a dipole.&nbsp; Therefore it is a means by which electric
      power may be coupled to &quot;free space&quot;.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">Depending upon the application, the main disadvantage
      may be the narrow bandwidth of the antenna.&nbsp; This is about 200 kHz as
      measured between the frequencies around 144.30 MHz at which the VSWR&nbsp;
      =&nbsp; 1.5<b>/</b>1, giving a Q of around 720.&nbsp; This is the
      inevitable consequence of the low-loss construction upon which its
      efficiency depends.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">It is important to note that the antenna is experimental
      only and was intended simply to demonstrate the potential of the Magnetic
      Loop Antenna principle at VHF.&nbsp; It cannot be used outdoors in wet
      weather without suitable protection.&nbsp; This is because of the high voltage
      developed across the capacitive gap.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">The photograph shows the antenna mounted on the roof of
      a car by using a mag-mount.&nbsp; This is an earlier version in which the
      coaxial cable is connected to the antenna by gamma matching.&nbsp; This
      was found to be inferior to inductive coupling in terms of the resulting
      VSWR.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><u><br>
      Conclusions</u>:<br>
      The writer believes that much remains to be discovered about the
      principles of the Magnetic Loop Antenna.&nbsp; The high voltage across the
      capacitive gap suggests that a voltage standing wave is developed around the
      periphery of the loop.&nbsp; However it is believed that there is no
      equivalent current standing wave, hence the magnitude of the current is
      substantially the same at any point around the loop.</font>

      <b><u>CAUTION:&nbsp; POSSIBLE HAZARD TO HEALTH</u></b></font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="4">
      The compact size of the antenna may tempt an experimentor to use it in close
      proximity to the him<b>/</b>herself, especially when first tuning up.&nbsp;
      The possible harmful effects of electromagnetic radiation on the body are the
      subject of international concern.&nbsp; The experimentor is therefore advised
      to use the antenna with great caution, especially to use as little power as
      possible when tuning and to avoid unnecessary exposure at all times.&nbsp;
      <b>In particular, a hand must NEVER be placed inside the loop with power applied.
