# vhf-magnetic-loop-antenna

I am a retired professional electronics engineer and I used to be a radio amateur.  I became intrigued by Magnetic Loop Antennas which are quite effective.
They are used where space is limited, or where regulations prohibit the attachment of antennas to rooftops.  But they are used only for HF (shortwave) frequencies.

So I decided to construct an experimental "mini" Magnetic Loop Antenna for amateur VHF frequencies (the 2 metre band - 144 MHz).
And it works very well.  It is not very practical but at least I proved that it works!
